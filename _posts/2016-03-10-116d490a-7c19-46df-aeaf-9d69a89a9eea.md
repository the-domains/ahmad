# The Key Process

The principle tools of Acusonic Therapy are hand hammered, seven-metal, singing bowls made in Nepal. Among the thousands of bowls that are made with the prayers and loving intentions of the artisans, we acutely select and match sets of bowls which are in tune with each other. This key process produces a set of tools which vibrate in mathematical resonant frequencies. The multi-note harmonic tones from each bowl oscillate within the ratios of sacred geometry (the patterns of the universe) thus entraining the patterns of the brain and cellular activity to states of relaxation in which the regenerative nature of the body, mind, and spirit (if perceived) are in their optimum environment for balance and rejuvenation.
