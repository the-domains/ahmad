PLANTS 

Plants help to create the air we breath and we help t0 create the air they breath. Our relationship is harmonious on every physical level and those levels that exist beyond the physical world for those who wish to perceive it. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bbcf790e-ccf4-4f9e-91c6-293dc40afe8f.jpg)

I work with plants on every level that I am able to understand. I know that I know so little, yet the plants are teaching me so much. My offering is to share the connection that I have with the world. To contribute to the wellbeing of the world around me. 

If this interests you, contact me for an exchange of energy within the plant kingdom.

I work with Amazonian master plants and North american herbs with the support of my partner, Reiki Master, and herbalist Gemma Danielle.
